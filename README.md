## Deployment

To use this application you need:

1. Go to folder cleaning_robot/src/main/java
2. Run
```bash
  chmod +x cleaningRobotRunner.sh
```
3. Run
```bash
  ./cleaningRobotRunner.sh inputFileName outputFileName
```
Or you can run it by its own, without parameters, just replace arguments in Main.java

Input files must be placed in cleaning_robot/src/main/files, output files too(they will be created if not exist)

## Junit tests
You can find some test I created, they are placed at folder cleaning_robot/src/test/java, some o them are using your provided files, also I have created input and expected output files for several scenarios.

## P.S.
Thank you for interesting task, your time and code review.
